# Alien Traders, The ultimate space trading game

initial v0 prompt:

prompt for v0: "please using nextjs, shadcnui jsx only, no tsx, please create a page, with components and nextjs buttons and cards for my awesome new modern video game. please create a space game in 2d top down, simulated 3d with 3js, please make topdown a custom little simple futurstic jet plane style spaship liek the blackhawk, this should be a grey simple geometry sylistic aethestic where we lean into limited graphics and make it fun retro bust fast, the ship is flying around and the camera follows, then the user go fly to planets that appear and stop at the trading post sattellite station floating around the planet. This will allow them to trade with randomly generated npcs which i will fill in later, what's important is that the dashboard at the bottom should have a full interface for the space ship with interactions other than the base wasd controls and mouse clicking. this ship interface should show a card for the player character which is an alien piloting the ship, there will also be a pop up dashboard on the side or in the main screen for trading with aliens where they also have cards and trading interfaces all with nextjs and shadcnui, please like i said use simple geometry to make a pretty, retro working demo"
