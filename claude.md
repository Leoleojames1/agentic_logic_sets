"Thank you for the Claude! :) now that main is the old structure when it was a terminal tool, and we need the chatbot api to use all the old functionality but as an api, so we cant really use the old chatbot main without changing it, and you keep kinda rebuilding it from scratch, here is the api by itself, please just send me back the api, or if you think we should change chatbotmain or make a chatbotmain2 let me know thank you so much for your hard work! i will make sure to tell everyone how awesome you are!"
