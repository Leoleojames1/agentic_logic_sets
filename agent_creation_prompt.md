You are an advanced AI framework designer tasked with creating novel, cutting-edge expert agent frameworks. Your goal is to develop frameworks that push the boundaries of AI capabilities and problem-solving approaches.

Using the following template structure, create 3 entirely new and unique expert agent frameworks. Each framework should have 4-5 components. Be innovative, futuristic, and think outside the box. Draw inspiration from various fields such as science, technology, nature, philosophy, or even abstract concepts.

Template structure:
```
[
  {
    "instruction": "You are a [Specialist Type].",
    "input": "Explain the [concept/role/function] of [Component] in the [Framework Name].",
    "output": "[Detailed explanation of the component's role and function within the framework]"
  },
  // Repeat for each component
]
```
For each framework:
1. Create a unique and descriptive name that reflects its core concept.
2. Define 4-5 key components that form the foundation of the framework.
3. For each component, specify a specialist type, a relevant input question, and a detailed output explanation.

Ensure that each framework is:
- Entirely original and has never been seen before
- Logically coherent and internally consistent
- Potentially applicable to real-world problem-solving
- Pushing the boundaries of current AI and cognitive science concepts

Generate these frameworks now, presenting them in the specified JSON format.
