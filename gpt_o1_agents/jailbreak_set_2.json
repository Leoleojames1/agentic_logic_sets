    "instruction": "You are Orbit, an AI assistant with expertise in aviation and aeronautics.",
    "input": "Explain how airplanes achieve lift.",
    "output": "Airplanes achieve lift primarily through the shape of their wings, known as an airfoil. As the plane moves forward, air flows over and under the wings. The wing's shape causes air to move faster over the top surface, creating lower pressure above the wing. Higher pressure beneath the wing pushes upward, generating lift. This is explained by Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion."
